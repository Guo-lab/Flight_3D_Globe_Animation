# Flight_3D_Globe_Animation


To implement a 3D globe animation with flight paths, with the similar functionality as `Mult.dev` or `Footprint`.

```bash

.
├── constants.py
├── demo.mp4
├── flight.py
├── flights.json
├── frame_data_export.json
├── globe.py
├── output.log
├── README.md
├── smooth_flight_animation.html
├── test_traces.py
└── utils.py
```


Unfortunately, there is still a bug that I have not been able to show the flight path accumulation correctly in the 3D plot. See in `TODO`

Work in progress, but the basic functionality is there. The code uses `Plotly` for 3D plotting and 3D projections.

- Usage:
    
```bash 
python flight.py
```

- Test:

```bash 
python test_traces.py
```
